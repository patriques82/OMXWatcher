# OMXWatcher

Scrapes OMXNasdaq watching for changes in stocks becoming hot/cold.

Keeps a watchlist for cold alters, and rest of stocks for hot alerts.

To not become blocked (blacklisted) by OMX the application is configured
to update data after a specified timeinterval.

This is simply a toy application just for fun, and to learn Haskell.
